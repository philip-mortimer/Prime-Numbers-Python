# Python program that prints a sequence of prime numbers

The program **sieve_of_eratosthenes.py** prints a sequence of prime numbers 
using the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

It prints all the prime numbers in the sequence *2..max_prime* inclusive where 
*max_prime* is the largest prime number which does not exceed the value of the
constant **N** near the top of the program.

Note that the **numpy** python library must be installed.
